## Error handling using Polly library
Demo that shows different techniques to handle errors with Polly

Polly is an open source framework for that "allows developers to express transient exception and fault handling policies such as Retry, Retry Forever, Wait and Retry, or Circuit Breaker in a fluent manner". Polly allows us to easily describe fault handling logic by creating a policy to represent the behaviour and then apply the policy to a delegate.
